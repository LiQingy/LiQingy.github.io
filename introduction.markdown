My name is Qingyang Li (Chinese characters: 李清洋). Now, I am earning my PhD degree at the department of astronomy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My works involove with galaxy clusters and galaxy formation in large scale structures. 

In past years, I focused on the baryonic distribution in hydrodynamical simulations, the dynamical mass estimation of galaxy clusters and construction of galaxy groups and protoclusters catalogue. Untile now, I have published seven papers, of which four papers are published at first author. You can find the details at section publications.

I am involved with [<font color="#0000dd">"the Three Hundred project"</font>](http://popia.ft.uam.es/The300-2022/Home.html) and Subaru [<font color="#0000dd">Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS)</font>](https://pfs.ipmu.jp/#:~:text=The%20PFS%20measures%20the%20large%20scale%20galaxy%20distribution,galaxies%20from%20cosmic%20dawn%20to%20the%20present%20day.). I learned to deal with simulation and observations data, and did analysis with machine learning tool. In the future, I am interested in the analysis of distant galaxies and doing works with machine learning.
