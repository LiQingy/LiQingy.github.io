My name is Qingyang Li (Chinese characters: 李清洋). Now, I am pursuing my PhD degree at the Department of Astronomy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My research focuses on studying galaxy formation and large-scale structures based on galaxy clusters. My study involves the utilization of both hydrodynamical simulations (specifically, runs in <a href="http://popia.ft.uam.es/The300-2022/Home.html" target= "_blank"><font color="#0000dd">the Three Hundred project</font></a> and <a href="http://simba.roe.ac.uk/" target= "_blank"><font color="#0000dd">SIMBA</font></a>) and observational data (<a href="https://www.clauds.net/" target= "_blank"><font color="#0000dd">CLAUDS</font></a> and <a href="https://hsc-release.mtk.nao.ac.jp/doc/" target= "_blank"><font color="#0000dd">HSC</font></a>), partly complemented by the application of machine learning techniques, including <b>Random Forest</b> and <b>Convolutional Neural Network</b>. <br><br>
  
In my prior research endeavors, I have predominantly delved into the realms of the <b>intracluster medium (ICM)</b>, <b>groups and protoclusters</b>, <b>galaxy dynamics</b>, and the application of <b>machine learning</b> methodologies. Until now, I have published 13 papers, of which 5 papers are published at first author. You can find the list in the section publications. <br><br>

I learned to deal with simulation and observation data, and did analysis with machine learning tool. In the future, I am interested in the analysis of distant galaxies and doing works with machine learning.
