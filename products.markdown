<b><font size=4>CLAUDS and HSC-SSP group and protocluster candidate catalogs</font></b>

<p>Using the extended halo-based group finder developed by <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...909..143Y/abstract">Yang et al. 2021</a>, which is able to deal with galaxies via spectroscopic and photometric redshifts simultaneously, we (<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac6e69">Li et al. 2022</a>) construct galaxy group and candidate protocluster catalogs in a wide redshift range (0 < z < 6) from the joint CFHT Large Area U-band Deep Survey (CLAUDS) and Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) deep data set. Based on a selection of 5,607,052 galaxies with i-band magnitude m<sub>i</sub> < 26 and a sky coverage of 34.41 deg<sup>2</sup>, we identify a total of 2,232,134 groups, within which 402,947 groups have at least three member galaxies. By checking the galaxy number distributions within a 5-7 h<sup>-1</sup>Mpc  projected separation and a redshift difference &Delta;z &le; 0.1 around those richest groups at redshift z > 2, we identified a list of 761, 343 and 43 protocluster candidates in the redshift bins 2 &le; z < 3, 3 &le; z < 4 and z &ge; 4, respectively.
